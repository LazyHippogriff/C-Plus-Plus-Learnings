In this program, we'll check if a header file containing namespace scoped
string variable when included by multiple cpp files can violate ODR.

Findings:
1. ODR was violated.
2. However, on making the variable const the program worked fine as const by
   default is static.
3. On making std::string as constexpr, the compiler gave errors. It turns out
   that std::string can't be constexpr. In C++17 there's string_view for that.
