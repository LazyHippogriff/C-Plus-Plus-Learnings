The program will calculate the flow capacity of a simple rectangular channel using a combination of slopes and materials of construction.

1. The program will open a csv file named "inputFile.csv" containing material name and corresponding manning roughness values. The material name and its manning roughness value will be comma separated.

2. If unable to open file, print error msg and terminate the application.

3. The program will read 5 lines from the input file. On each line, the string before comma would be treated as the name of the material and the float value after the comma will be treated as the manning roughness value of that material.

4. If file couldn't be opened or there is any error in reading 5 lines from the input file, an error msg will be displayed and the application will be terminated.

5. The program will then ask the user for 4 values i.e. channel width, channel depth, slope rise and slope run.

6. If any of these 4 values is negative, the program will display an error message and terminate.

7. If the values have been successfully taken from the user, the app will display the channel diagram using stars and dashes.

8. A table would be displayed on screen that has the slope as the X axis and the materials as the Y axis. The slope value will start from 0.01 and will be incremented by 0.05 till 0.21. The flow rates will than be calculated for each material-slope pair. 

9. The channel shape and the results table will need to be written to both the screen and a text file. The text file shall be named theAdventuresOfZorro.txt. If there is an error in opening the file, the program will display an error message and terminate.
