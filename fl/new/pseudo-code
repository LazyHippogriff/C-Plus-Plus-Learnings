1. Read the values of 'Name of the steel section', 'Effective Section Modulus(Zx)', 'The second moment of area about the minor y axis(Iy)', 'Section Torsion Constant(J)' and 'Section Warping Constant(Iw)' from the input file.

2. Calculate 'Section Capacity(Ms)'.

3. for(udl between 1 to 10) { //udl is uniform distributed load in kN/m
  for(le between 0 to 10) { //le is the length of the beam(in m)
    if(le!=0) {
      Calculate Bending Moment(Moment).
        Calculate Member Bending Capacity(Mb)
        Store Max(Moment/Ms,Moment/Mb) in output file against udl and le.
    }
    if(le == 0) {
      Calculate Bending Moment(Moment) with beam length = 5m.
        store Moment/Ms in the output file against udl and le.
    }
  }
}
